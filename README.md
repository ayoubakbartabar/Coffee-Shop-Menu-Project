# ☕ Before The Coffee Gets Cold – Café Menu Web App

> Inspired by a novel where a cup of coffee offers more than taste – it offers a journey through time.  
> Now, your café menu offers more than just drinks – it creates an experience.

## 🔮 About the Project

**Before The Coffee Gets Cold** is a digital café menu web app, inspired by the beautiful book *"Before the Coffee Gets Cold"* by **Toshikazu Kawaguchi**.  
Just like the novel’s magical café where time travel is possible, this app lets your customers experience your café in a unique, interactive way.


## 🌐 Live Demo

📲 Place a QR code on any table, and with a simple scan, customers will instantly access your digital café menu!

## 🧠 Why This Project Stands Out

🌐 **No App Needed** – Customers simply scan a QR code to enter your café’s digital world.

📝 **Live Interactive Menu** – Instantly view product names, prices, availability status (in stock/out of stock), and real-time updates.

💬 **Customer Reviews** – Each item features honest reviews and ratings from previous guests, making decision-making easier and more transparent.

🛒 **Order Directly from the Table** – No waiting. No waving hands. Let your customers place their orders right from their seat.

📱 **Fully Responsive** – Seamlessly works across all screen sizes – from smartphones to tablets.
